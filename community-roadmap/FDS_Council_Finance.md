# Functional Design Specification:

### Objective:
The objective of this functional design specification is to develop an interactive online dashboard to visualize the 
data of Joystream DAO spendings since the mainnet launch.

###Scope:
The dashboard should include three widgets: a chart to visualize council overall spending, a chart to visualize WG 
spendings, and pie charts to visualize relative WG spendings.

### Functional Requirements:
- First, there should be a chart with Council overall spending. The chart should include spendings for each term including 
- the current term. Spendings should be presented in both JOY and USD equivalents.
- Second, there should be a chart with WG spendings, for each WG. The chart should include spendings for each term including 
- the current term. Spendings should be presented in both JOY and USD equivalents.
- Third, there should be pie charts with relative WG spendings, for each WG. There should be separate charts for each term. 
- Pie charts should be presented only in JOY.

Additionally, the dashboard should include a search functionality that enables users to search for specific spendings by term and/or WG.
The dashboard should also include a filter functionality that enables users to filter spendings by term and/or WG.
