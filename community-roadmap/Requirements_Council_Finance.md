### DAO Spendings Dashboard 

### Objective
The aim of this functional design specification is to set out the requirements for the BWG to create an interactive online dashboard to display data on the Joystream DAO's expenditures. This data is necessary for the Council to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently.

### Scope
The dashboard should include three widgets: a chart to visualize council overall spending, a chart to visualize WG 
spendings, and pie charts to visualize relative WG spendings.

### Requirements
- First, there should be a chart with Council overall spending. The chart should include spendings for each term including the current term. Spendings should be presented in both JOY and USD equivalents.
- Second, there should be a chart with WG spendings, for each WG. The chart should include spendings for each term including the current term. Spendings should be presented in both JOY and USD equivalents.
- Third, there should be pie charts with relative WG spendings, for each WG. There should be separate charts for each term. Pie charts should be presented only in JOY.

Additionally, the dashboard should include a search functionality that enables users to search for specific spendings by term and/or WG.
The dashboard should also include a filter functionality that enables users to filter spendings by term and/or WG.
