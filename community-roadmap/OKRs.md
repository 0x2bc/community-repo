# About

This Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) guideline is designed to provide a framework for measuring the overall performance of the system, providing a signal to the council about how well the system is operating. The signal from this measurement will allow the council to adjust policies and reallocate resources to improve the performance of the system, ensuring that it is running as efficiently as possible.

OKRs should be used to guide activities and decision making within the WGs (working groups). By regularly tracking progress against the objectives, the working group can ensure that all members are working towards the same goal, and that progress is being made.
