# About

This Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) guideline is designed to provide a framework for measuring the overall performance of the system, providing a signal to the council about how well the system is operating. The signal from this measurement will allow the council to adjust policies and reallocate resources to improve the performance of the system, ensuring that it is running as efficiently as possible.

OKRs should be used to guide activities and decision making within the WGs (working groups). By regularly tracking progress against the objectives, the working group can ensure that all members are working towards the same goal, and that progress is being made.

# High level scores

The DAO overall has high level OKRs that it needs to focus and improve on. Below is a list of these high level OKRs. We will further break down these high level OKRs into individual OKRs for each working group in the next paragraphs. By focusing on these high level OKRs, we can ensure that all working groups have a clear understanding of the goals and objectives of the DAO.

## 1. Earning

For DAO to function properly and sustainably, it needs to generate income. This includes all sources of revenue that benefit the DAO. Though this is a bit different from a typical organization, as DAO spends its earnings from the JOY inflation.

Such earnings can be interpreted broadly: they include not only JOY earnings that DAO receive directly but all factors that affect the price of JOY token.

### **1.1 Gateway’s Payments**

We need to ensure that revenue from gateway providers is maximized and continues to grow over time. In turns, payments received from gateways basically depends on the following factors:

```jsx
GTW_PAYMENTS = GTW_NUMBERS * GTW_RESOURCES_CONSUMED * GTW_RESOURCES_PRICE
```

This formula gives us an overview of the main factors to consider when calculating earnings. In reality, we need to calculate each gateway provider's earnings separately. To get an accurate amount, we should multiply the cost of each resource used by the price of that resource, and then make a sum.

**1.1.1 GTW_PAYMENTS** 

Amount of payments we get from the gateways 

**1.1.2 GTW_NUMBERS** 

Amount of gateways

**1.1.3** **GTW_RESOURCES_CONSUMED** 

Amount of resources consumed. It’s in our own benefit and both Gateway operators benefir to focus on maximization of the following metrics:

1.1.3.1 Number of creators across the app

1.1.3.2 Number of monthly active users across the app

1.1.3.3 Number of channels across the app

1.1.3.4 Hours of watched video content across the app

1.1.3.5 Average user session time

**1.1.4** **GTW_RESOURCES_PRICE** 

Price per resource. Different resources may have different prices.

### **1.2 Tokens burned**

There are different ways tokens can be removed from circulation. These may include token burning, permanent locking, sending tokens to an address from where they can't be retrieved, etc.

**1.2.1 Gleev tokens burn**

1.2.1.1.  NFT minting

Every time an NFT is minted, Joystream takes a fee. This is also the case on all sales, both primary and secondary, just like on a platform like OpenSea.

1.2.1.2 Creators token fee

As you know, every creator can have their own token, and the same way an exchange like Binance charges a small fee on the trading of a token, so does Joystream.

### **1.3 Tokens in lockup**

Number of tokens in lockup should be maximized. This category may include tokens that are

- Staked and nominated
- Used for voting
- Bonded for role
- Vested

## 2. Costs

We need to reduce our operational costs while remaining competitive in terms of pricing but still making sure we provide high-quality infrastructure services.

- WG and Council Salaries
- Marketing costs
- Validator rewards
- Grants and bounties
- Other one-time costs

We should also make sure that fewer JOY tokens are made available on the public market so the selling pressure is reduced. In some sense high selling pressure can be considered as a financial burden or “cost” for DAO.

## 3. Quality of service

We have to guarantee that we offer reliable and excellent performing services

- Storage system
    - Аast and reliable uploading, minimal chances of data loss, a high upload speed, the ability to handle multiple uploads simultaneously, quick replication of new data objects to all providers, quick synchronization of new storage providers, and protection from denial of service attacks.
- Distribution system
    - Low latency and reliable downloading, high download speed, high download volume capacity with many simultaneous parallel downloads, a high download speed from the storage provider, a low replication latency for a new data objects to all distributors, and a low synchronization time of new distributors.
- Content
    - Moderation. Ensuring that the content available through the platform's public applications is legal, properly licensed and appropriate for the testnet environment and its participants.
    - Featuring. Ensuring that the most impressive content available on the platform is promoted to the maximum extent possible given the tools available, and as regularly as is feasible considering the volume of new high-quality content coming in.
    - Metadata Integrity. On the testnet environment, partially as a training exercise which will develop participants familiarity with the structure of the content directory, there will be a focus on maintaining a "clean" directory of content, with effective titles, descriptions, thumbnails and other metadata, as well as correct license information and the deployment of attribution best practices, and also the avoidance of spam.
- Apps & Builders
    - Manage the number of tokens going from the Gleev or other Gateway platform per unit of service. Assist the accumulating discrepancies between requested payment magnitudes from the provider (Joystream DAO), and the reports accumulated by the gateway
    - Help answer technical inquiries about integration with Joystream CDN from the Gleev team or other gateways.

## 5. Product development

BWG and the JSgenesis team should continue deeply collaborate to address issues and enhance the Pioneer, Atlas, and other products. 

## 6. Ecosystem development

We should work hard to increase the number of dApps and services in our ecosystem, promote development activity, and strengthen the perception of the Joystream ecosystem among external entities

### 6.1 Tools and services

Boost the quality and quantity of tools and services available to the Joystream community.

### 6.2 Software developers

Ensuring that the number of software developers and their associated tech community (QA, desiners, etc) is growing and their daily activities are increasing, this ultimately leads to more tools and services becoming available.

### 6.3 Assistance and support

The DAO must ensure that it is providing all necessary support to the ecosystem in order to promote its growth. This includes technical assistance, guides and tutorials, the necessary tools, and financing. All of these elements are essential for the successful growth of the ecosystem.
