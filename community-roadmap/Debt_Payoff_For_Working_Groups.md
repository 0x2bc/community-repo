# Debt Payoff For Working Groups

*Comment by 0x2bc: In this document I have attempted to answer all questions and clear up any confusion about the topic of Debt Payoff For Working Groups .*

# About

This document outlines the rationale behind the Council's decision to disburse additional funds (pay out debt) to the working groups,  the period and activities for which the Council intend to make mentioned payments, as well as the rate of payments and terms thereof. The document also provides details on how payment can be made technically.

# Reasoning

In light of the fact that certain Working Groups have been engaged in their duties for approximately one month, at the close of 2022, without any rewards for their services, the Council has committed to providing compensation for all of their work performed.

Working Groups persisted to operate during the transitional period between testnets, a period in which the Council was unable to provide payment due to a lack of budget. Though the work performed was of paramount importance, such as the resolution of Pioneer problems prior to the mainnet launch, for example.

# Payoff Details

### 1. Period

Council owes WGs for debts they have incurred in the following time periods

**Transitional periods**

No payment was received by the WGs when they were between the Rhodes and Carthage stages and also between the Carthage and Mainnet launch (which we call transitional periods**)**.

**Carthage testnet period**

Some WGs were only paid for part of their work, while others were not paid at all due to the proposal limit and budget constraints during the Carthage testnet.

### 2. Amount

For the purpose of the experiment, we will be making payments one by one. This time, the Builders Working Group will be receiving the payment. If everything goes smooth we will repeat the procedure for the rest of WGs. 

#### **Payments for BWG** 

- Payment for the Builder WG will be made [to the report provided](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xh5_BJqg9iMksyDS7CI5LyH2jbv3jupdv1vXjJ5aFbk/edit#gid=0).
- A total of 1,650,000 JOY to be distributed among 11 employees.
- The report and the BWG work done were investigated thoroughly by different Councils during the December-January timeframe and it was found to be satisfactory.
- Payments in the testnet were much higher than on the mainnet. Following the agreement between the BWG and Council, the rate of 1SP to 500USD is being used for the BWG payment. This rate is something between what we have on testnet and what we have on mainnet.

#### **Payments for the rest of WGs**

- The debt amount for the rest of WGs will be determined based on their [previously submitted reports](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N4cH4m1VwD3gdOco1-1ZBhafa_IxCNdVbXPEVe7DyFQ/edit#gid=0).
- The amount of debt owed to the WGs was [partially settled according to the table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pYio_CubyHe5prmnHS2E470Db_XWRiLrvhlqXk9ZPws/edit#gid=887994203), and this should be taken into account when compiling the final list of payments to be made.

**Important notice:** the ratio of debt among workers will remain the same as in the table provided, however the overall amount will be determined according to the rate we used for BWG rewards. This rate is something between what we have on testnet and what we have on mainnet.

### 3. Vesting schedule

Payment for all debts must be 8% at the time of payment, and the remainder to be vested for two years, with a linear unlock

# Next Steps

### Technical implementation

1. The Council raises WG's Budget in proportion to the amount of debt that they have paid off. 
2. The Lead is given a list by the Council of members who should be given JOY and the amount of JOY each should receive.
3. Lead  make payments according to the list provided and following the rules how to created vesting payments 
4. The Lead  pay out in accordance with the given list and taking into account the [vesting procedure](https://pioneerapp.xyz/#/forum/thread/101) guideline.
