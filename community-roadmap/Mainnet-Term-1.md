## About

Before the mainnet council is chosen, it is important to have everything as ready as possible. However, there are still a few points that need to be discussed further within the community, such as the initial composition of the Working Groups and the initial salaries. To move forward on this, I have put forth my ideas on these matters below. This can be the first step in resolving the issues. 

I intentionally suggest some Working Groups not fully staffed in the first mainnet term, as the process will be rolled out gradually. 
The salaries for this first term may seem a bit rough and may be subject to change later based on the new scoring system (WIP).

## Salaries

#### Key principles:
- Salaries are based on the [JSG's inputs](https://gist.github.com/bedeho/1b231111596e25b215bc66f0bd0e7ccc) and my own market sense 
- Salaries are to be paid in JOY equivalent by the rate of 0.06 USD/JOY (assuming no exchange in 1st term)
- Council will aim to reduce the number of people in the working groups, while increasing their commitment to the project. This will minimize communication costs and facilitate a more effective learning process, leading to better results.
- Council members will combine or heavily assist the lead/workers roles in the beginning
- Council will continue to experiment with salaries during the first term and will develop a more reliable compensation system in the second or third term
- JSG [recommended](https://gist.github.com/bedeho/1b231111596e25b215bc66f0bd0e7ccc#budgets--spending-and-inflation) to spend as little as 10k USD per month totally for Content, Membership, Forum, HR, Marketing WGs  for the first few months

#### Leads & Council
- Council: 10k USD/month
- Builders/Storage/Distribution: 5k USD/month + 50USD/hour (for every next working hour exceeding 80hours per month) 
- Content/Membership: council will take these duties
- Forum/HR/Marketing WGs: 50 USD/hour
- Gateway WG: 50 USD/hour

#### Workers
- All WGs (except Storage/Distribution): 40 USD/hour
- Storage/Distribution node runners: 1000 USD/month
