# Reporting guide

### Overview 

Joystream DAO is a large organization that performs a significant number of tasks and produces a 
large number of documents. In order to accurately measure the performance of the system, the 
Council must assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. 

This guide provides reporting procedures and templates for the Working Group (WG) reports, which 
will aid the Council in this evaluation process. The accompanying template included in this guide 
will help streamline the process of drafting WG reports.

#### Reporting milestones

- WG Report: Council Election (0h -> 24h) 
- Council Report: Council Election (+0h) -> Council Election (+24h)
- Council Plan: Council Election (+0h) -> Council Election (+24h)

- Council Report: Council Election + 24h 

### Reporting folder
The council and each working group must maintain its own Notion board where a body of knowledge related to the operations of the 
group are maintained. This base will be owned by Jsgenesis, while on testnet, and the current lead of each working group and all 
council members will be given write access to maintain it. The integrity of the boards is the responsibility of each person 
granted access, and sharing of credentials is not allowed. If this constraint causes problems in efficiently maintaining 
the boards, contact Jsgenesis.
