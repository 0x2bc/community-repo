# JOY Listing 

In this article, I have outlined the objectives, possible action items, and other importnat information concerning the JOY token listing.

### Problem

It's essential for the community to have the opportunity to exchnage their JOY salaries to fiat and cover their living expenses so that they can stay committed to the development of the project. The JOY token is not traded on the open market now though the listing process could potentially take months, so it is important to start as soon as possible. 

### Goals

Our short-term goal is to get the JOY token listed on a trustworthy exchange, ensuring that it is highly liquid and the community can trade on it freely. We must be mindful of the limitation of making sure the token price is fair in comparison with the market capitalization of similar projects and our most recent valuation.

Our long-term goal is to get the JOY token tradeable in a few different exchanges including most popular DEXes and CEXes as well as maki sure token can be easily bridget to the Moonbeam (Polkadot) and Ethereum blockchains.

## Roles

**Council:**

1. Arrange the listing task in a way that ensures it has the highest priority
2. Appoint an individual (may be a Council member) who will be wholly devoted to the task and accountable for the outcome. This person can accomplish the task independently or coordinate the efforts of other members of the group.

**Responsible person:**

1. Conduct Research 
Gather all the listing-related information and present it to the Council

2. Develop Startegy
Construct a listing strategy based on the Council feedback and initial objectives, and ensure that all Council members approve on it.

3. Get JOY listed
Implement the agreed strategy into real life. Orchestrate the activities of everyone involved. 

These items are described in detail in the following section.

# Work plan (detailed)

## 1. Conduct Research

At first step, gather listing related information:

#### Any preferences from exchnages-investors to JSG?

Normally it takes a lot of money to get a token listed on exchanges. But in our case we have well-known exchanges as our early contributors to the Joystream. This may allow us to get better conditions for a listing.

Exchanges that are our contributors (see the full [list](https://arcticstartup.com/joystream-raised-d-5-85-m/) here):

- OKX [www.okx.com](https://www.okx.com/)
- MEXC [https://m.mexc.com](https://m.mexc.com/)
- GateIO [https://www.gate.io](https://www.gate.io/)

#### What are terms of listing for the rest CEXes/DEXes? 

The work has started and need to be finzlized [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/865)
 - Name 
 - URL
 - CEX or DEX
 - Substrate support?
 - Exchnage tier: CMC ranking
 - Cost of listing: does it require fiat payment
 - Other requirements (trading volumes, safe deposit amount, application review period, what jurisdiction they operate from)
 - Link to submit application

#### Bridging 

Figure out whether we can quickly launch bridging with Moonbeam/Ethereum networks. 
- Follow up the conversation in the Moonbeam [tech support](https://discord.com/channels/745382242326413442/930467366268198912/1059188993385824267) 
- Communicate with @mrbovo.eth on his [bridging technology research](https://discord.com/channels/811216481340751934/1035124335255506984/1059754673797607465)

#### Internal competences 

See if anyone in the community has easy access to exchanges and try to use their contacts. Determine if anyone has listed something on exchanges and figure out the procedure.

## 2. Develop Startegy
Construct a listing strategy based on the Council feedback and initial objectives, and ensure that all Council members approve on it.

Make sure the strategy includes the following items 

#### Decrease selling pressure
- what we do to maximize amount of JOY out of circulation through staking, voting, etc
- what we do to increase JOY attractiveness for current holders to make them keep token for long-term

#### Boost buying power
Will we run an extensive marketing campaign to advertise JOY to outside groups? How will it look like?
- grants to joystream community to have a better foundation for listing. they can create video or text content on the following topics  (how i see joystream in 5 years, what are best utilities for JOY token, how it works etc)
- project overview in top media otlet (cointelegrap, etc)
- buy youtube bloggers and KOLs overviree of the project
- 

#### Liquidity 
- will we provide liquidity for DEXes? if so, will we have incentive program for liquidity providers? 
- will we hire market makers for CEXes?

## 3. Get JOY listed

Implement the agreed strategy into real life. Orchestrate the activities of everyone involved. 

Get the JOY token listed on a trustworthy exchange, ensuring that it is highly liquid and the community can trade on it freely. We must be mindful of the limitation of making sure the token price is fair in comparison with the market capitalization of similar projects and our most recent valuation.
