# Listing Strategy (draft v1) 

### About

This article outlines the necessary steps to develop a listing strategy for the JOY token, including a list of objectives and possible action items, as well as important information to consider prior to listing.

### Background

It's essential for the community to have the opportunity to exchnage their JOY salaries to fiat and cover their living expenses so that they can stay committed to the development of the project. The JOY token is not traded on the open market now though the listing process could potentially take months, so it is important to start as soon as possible.

### Goals

Our short-term goal is to get the JOY token listed on a trustworthy exchange in a brief period of time, ensuring that it is highly liquid and the community can trade on it freely. We must be mindful of the limitation of making sure the token price is fair in comparison with the market capitalization of similar projects and our most recent valuation.

Our long-term goal is to get the JOY token tradeable in a few different exchanges including most popular DEXes and CEXes as well as making sure token can be easily bridging to the Moonbeam (Polkadot) and Ethereum blockchains.

# Solution

### Organization

I suggest assigning one person to take charge of the listing task and make him orchestrating other community memebers and teams working to this task. This should help create more efficiency and expedite the process.

**Council:**

1. Arrange the listing task in a way that ensures it has the highest priority
2. Appoint an individual who will be wholly devoted to the task and accountable for the outcome. This person can accomplish the task independently or coordinate the efforts of other community members.

**Responsible person:**

1. Conduct Research: Gather all the listing-related information and present it to the Council
2. Develop Startegy: Construct a listing strategy based on the Council feedback and initial objectives, and ensure that all Council members approve on it.
3. Get JOY listed: Implement the agreed strategy into real life. Orchestrate the related activities. 

### Listing Strategy

Strategy should include a thorough analysis of the situation and a step-by-step plan for achieving the stated goal:

> In a brief period of time get JOY token listed on a trustworthy exchange, ensuring that it is highly liquid and the community can trade on it freely. Be mindful of the limitation of making sure the token price is fair in comparison with the market capitalization of similar projects and our most recent valuation.

Among other things strategy should highlight the following items:

#### Should we get listed in a first place on exchnages that are our investors?

Normally it takes a lot of money to get a token listed on exchanges. But in our case we have well-known exchanges as our early contributors and investors to the Joystream. This may allow us to get better conditions for a listing.

Exchanges that are our contributors (see the full [list](https://arcticstartup.com/joystream-raised-d-5-85-m/) here):

- OKX [www.okx.com](https://www.okx.com/)
- MEXC [https://m.mexc.com](https://m.mexc.com/)
- GateIO [https://www.gate.io](https://www.gate.io/)

#### What are terms of listing for the rest CEXes/DEXes? 

The result should be a table with the following data 
 - Exchange Name 
 - URL
 - CEX or DEX
 - Substrate support?
 - Exchnage tier: CMC ranking
 - Cost of listing: does it require fiat payment
 - Other requirements (trading volumes, safe deposit amount, application review period, what jurisdiction they operate from)
 - Link to submit application
 - Overall rate

The work has already started and need to be finzlized [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/865)

#### Which are sources of funding for listing?  

- If Council needs to make fiat payments in order to list JOY tokens, what sources should they use?

#### Should we use bridging instead of listings?

Bridging can give us access to the most popular DEXes on Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems.  Can we launch bridges quickly on the indicated networks and what technical challenges might arise? What development scope is necessary?

#### Are there any advisors available to assist us with listings?

- Check if anyone in the community has easy access to exchanges. Try to use their contacts. Determine if anyone has listed something on exchanges and figure out the procedure.
- See if any of JSG investors can assist on listings 

#### How can we decrease selling pressure?

- What can we  do to maximize amount of JOY out of circulation through staking, voting, etc
- How can we make JOY more appealing to current holders so that they hold the token for the long term?

#### How can we boost buying power?
Should we run an extensive marketing campaign to advertise JOY to outside groups?
The following are suggested marketing activities:
- Work with KOLs (social media, youtube, etc )
- Project review in bankless, messari, delphi digital, etc
- Paid articles in top media outlet (cointelegrap, etc)
- Offering grants to the community to promote knowledge of our project. This media content can cover various subjects, such as: What could Joystream look like in five years, What are the best uses of the JOY token, How the platform works, What are benefits of content creator to use Joystream, etc

#### Liquidity 
- How to maintain liquidity for DEXes? if so, should we launch an incentive program for liquidity providers? 
- Should we hire market makers for CEXes?
