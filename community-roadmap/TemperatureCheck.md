# Lising: Request for comments

#### ABOUT

Community temperature check for JOY listings. Request for comments.

#### BACKGROUND

The JOY token is not traded on the open market now, but community should have the opportunity to exchnage their JOY salaries to fiat i.e. to cover their living expenses so that they can stay committed to the development of the project.

The Council is on the brink of acting on this matter. 

But prior to dedicating time and resources to entertain the rigorous listing process, I would like to clarify if there is a general interest from the Joystream community and what is community opinion on the following topics.

This is an open discussion every opinion is welcome.  

#### DISCUSSION TOPICS

- Should we wait for a specific market conditions or list now?
- Should Joystream DAO pursue listing on a centralized or decentralized exchange?
- What exchanges are most interesting to our community?
- What are some red flags or considerations we should have as we pursue these activities?
